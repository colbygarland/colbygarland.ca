                <h5>Project: Logo design/branding</h5>
                <p>Colby worked with us to help us design our logo at Grassroots Realty. We had a vision and some key elements, but couldn't bring it to life. We consulted with Colby, and he absolutely NAILED IT in finding a logo that represented Us and what our brand stands for. Colby is extremely creative, hard working, and has a great sense of humour. Our logo has been the cornerstone to the brand and a huge factor in our success. I recommend Colby 11/10 for logo design!</p>

                <h5>Project: Website design/development</h5>
                <p>I'd highly recommend Colby! When I first decided on getting my photography website up and running I wanted it to be completely customized to my vision, and Colby was able to do just that! We had many meetings where we sat down and went over my plans and ideas throughout the process to make sure everything was how I wanted. Updating my blog and making changes throughout my website is so <strong>easy to do</strong>, Colby walked me through it before hand so I would have the knowledge that I need to do the basics. Since then some bigger changes have been made to my website (logo change and home page layout) where I've had to asked him several questions regarding those changes. If I'm unsure how to change something he's just a text a way and is always accommodating and so helpful!</p>
