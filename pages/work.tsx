      <p>
        I build custom mobile-friendly websites tailored to your needs. Have a previous design? No problem. Want to be able to make updates to it yourself?
        Giddy up. Whether it's a single page site, or a multi-page update-yourself-er, I'm down to help you achieve your vision.

      <h3>I build software.</h3>
      <p>Mobile apps, web apps, whatever the case may be, I love building software solutions to your problems.</p>
